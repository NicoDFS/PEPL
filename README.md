#PEPL (Prediction EPL)

###Point
- 3PTS spot-on
- 2PTS goal-difference
- 1PT side
- 0PT wrong
- -1PT forfeit

###Game Rules
- prediction is only allowed on matches that will begin in the next 24 hours
- predictions are LOCKED 30 minutes prior to kickoff
- once a prediction is sent in, it's FINAL

###Notes from MaMoe
- the app doesn't have password recovery, so make sure your password is memorable [I'll use OAuth of Google or something l8r]
- app uses HTML5 manifest, so if you're *here* the app is cheap to use (initial load is about `~2.4MB`)

###Help
any help is greatly appreciated
